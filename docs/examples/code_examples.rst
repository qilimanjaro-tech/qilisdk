- **Digital circuits** (:doc:`circuits`) build, visualize, and sample gate-based programs.
- **Hamiltonian builders** (:doc:`hamiltonians`) compose analog models from Pauli operators and custom terms.
- **Time evolution** (:doc:`time_evolution`) simulate schedules with intermediate-state inspection and observables.
- **Quantum objects** (:doc:`quantum_objects`) manipulate states, operators, and tensor utilities shared across modules.
- **Model library** (:doc:`models`) stitch ansatze, optimizers, and functionals into full algorithms.
