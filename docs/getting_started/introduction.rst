Introduction
===============

Welcome to **QiliSDK**, a unified Python framework for developing, simulating, and running both digital and analog quantum algorithms across a variety of backends (CPU, GPU, and cloudâ€‘based QaaS). Its modular design makes it easy to prototype circuits, build Hamiltonians, design variational workflows, and deploy them on local or remote quantum simulators.
