Added initial Sphinx‚Äêbased documentation for QiliSDK, complete with a fully-configured `conf.py` that injects our source path, enables key extensions (Napoleon for Google-style docstrings, Graphviz, Viewcode, AutoAPI for live API reference, nbsphinx, sphinx\_design, and markdown includes), and applies the Sphinx Awesome Theme with custom light/dark logos, favicon, and CSS overrides.  The build now generates a polished HTML site (deployed at [https://qilimanjaro-tech.github.io/qilisdk/](https://qilimanjaro-tech.github.io/qilisdk/)) featuring module overviews, "Getting Started" guides, and deep dives into digital, analog, backend, and QaaS components, laying the groundwork for ongoing documentation enhancements.
