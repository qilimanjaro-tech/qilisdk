Added TrotterizedTimeEvolution with state initialization, introduced reusable trotterization utilities, tightened time-evolution state validation. Circuit now supports list-based add/insert, circuit append/prepend, and gate/circuit addition operators with new tests and documentation for those behaviors. Expanded docs/tests for trotterization, QAOA behavior, and backends.

Examples:
```python
from qilisdk.analog.hamiltonian import Z
from qilisdk.analog.schedule import Schedule
from qilisdk.digital import H
from qilisdk.digital.ansatz import TrotterizedTimeEvolution

schedule = Schedule(
    hamiltonians={"h": Z(0)},
    coefficients={"h": {0.0: 1.0, 1.0: 1.0}},
    dt=0.1,
    total_time=1.0,
)
ansatz = TrotterizedTimeEvolution(
    schedule=schedule,
    trotter_steps=2,
    state_initialization=[H(0)],
)
ansatz.draw()
```

```python
from qilisdk.analog.hamiltonian import X, Z
from qilisdk.utils.trotterization import trotter_evolution

hamiltonian = X(0) + 2 * Z(0)
gates = list(trotter_evolution(hamiltonian, time=0.5, trotter_steps=2))
```
