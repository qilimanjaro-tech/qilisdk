Drafted initial directory structure and configuration:

- **Module Separation**
  Separated modules into `common`, `analog`, `digital`, `utils`, and `extras`, with the last one reserved for optional features.

- **Dynamic Dependency Detection**
  Implemented a custom mechanism that checks which dependencies are installed. If a dependency required for an optional feature is missing, a stub is generated that raises an exception when used.

- **Local Testing with Tox**
  Configured Tox to run tests locally. To install Tox, run:
  ```bash
  uv tool install tox --with tox-uv
  ```
  Then, execute all tests using:
  ```bash
  tox -p
  ```
  To run tests for a specific environment use the `-e` option. For example, in order to run tests for the core features in Python 3.12 you should run:
  ```
  tox -p -e py312-core
  ```
  You can find all declared environments in `pyproject.toml`.

- **GitHub Actions Workflows**
  - **Publish**: Deploys the package to PyPI
  - **Code Quality**: Performs linting, formatting, and type checking
  - **Tests**: Runs tests with pytest
  - **Tests with Tox**: Runs tests with Tox (included for performance comparison)

- **Changelog Management**
  Configured Towncrier to manage and maintain the project changelog.
