Introduces the `Hamiltonian` class as a central component for Pauli-based operator arithmetic, with a flyweight pattern for single-qubit operators. Internally stores terms as a dictionary mapping tuples of `PauliOperator` objects to complex coefficients.

**Key Features**

1. **Flyweight Pauli Operators**
   - `Z`, `X`, `Y`, `I` constructors backed by a cache to avoid repeated instantiation of identical operators.
   - Concrete classes `PauliZ`, `PauliX`, `PauliY`, and `PauliI` handle core matrix definitions and qubit association.

2. **Dictionary-Based Storage**
   - Each Hamiltonian term is keyed by a tuple of `PauliOperator` objects (e.g. `(Z(0), Y(1))`) associated with a complex coefficient.
   - Uses `defaultdict(complex)` for coefficient accumulation.

3. **Arithmetic Operations**
   - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with other Hamiltonians, individual Pauli operators, or scalars (`int`, `float`, `complex`).
   - Merges like terms automatically (e.g., `(Z(0) + Z(0))` becomes `2*Z(0)`).
   - Distributes terms for Hamiltonian–Hamiltonian multiplication, applying a Pauli product table to compute phases and resulting operators on a per-qubit basis.

4. **Simplification**
   - Removes terms below a configurable threshold (`_EPS`).
   - Aggregates any single-qubit identity operators `I(q)` into `I(0)` for a canonical form.

5. **Iteration Protocol**
   - Exposes `__iter__` returning `(coefficient, list_of_operators)` pairs, facilitating term-by-term processing without a separate parsing function.

6. **Equality Check**
   - Implements `__eq__` to compare Hamiltonians and detect pure scalar cases (`I(0) * c`).
   - Recognizes an effectively “zero” Hamiltonian and treats it consistently.

7. **String Representation**
   - Renders numeric coefficients in a concise format (omitting unnecessary decimals).
   - Correctly handles purely real or imaginary parts, negative signs, and identity terms.
   - Arranges single identity terms `I(0)` to appear first.

8. **Parse Method**
   - Implements a `@classmethod` named `parse` that reconstructs a Hamiltonian from its string representation.
   - Allows round-trip conversions (str(ham) → parse(...) → ham) for saving, logging, or user input.

### Code Example

```python
from qilisdk.analog import Hamiltonian, X, Y, Z, I

# Create a Hamiltonian using Pauli Operators
H = (Z(0) + X(0)) * (Z(0) - X(0))

# Access each term
for coeff, ops in product:
    print("Coefficient:", coeff, "Operators:", ops)

# Check equality
assert H == -2j * Y(0), "Both expressions yield the same Hamiltonian."

print(H)  # -2j Y(0)

# Parse a string to Hamiltonian
parsed_hamiltonian = Hamiltonian.parse("-2j Y(0)")

# Check equality
assert H == parsed_hamiltonian, "Hamiltonians are equal"
```

This release provides a robust framework for Pauli-operator arithmetic, scalar integration, and canonical simplification, forming a foundation for higher-level quantum analog functionality.
