Users can now set the environment variable `QILISDK_COMPLEX_PRECISION` to either `COMPLEX_64` or `COMPLEX_128`, making it easy to globally select the complex dtype used across dense and sparse matrices; if the variable is unset we continue to default to the project-wide precision defined in `settings.py`.
