Added a new simulation backend: QiliSim. This is an internal simulator written in C++. It offers improved performance compared to the QuTiP CPU simulator and can even be faster than the CUDA backend for some small test cases. Both circuit simulation and time evolution are supported. There are a number of time evolution methods: direct exponention, Anrolid/Krylov exponentiation, RK4 integration, and Monte Carlo (which can be combined with any of the previous methods).

Circuit sampling with QiliSim can be done as follows:
```python
from qilisdk.digital import Circuit, H, CNOT
from qilisdk.functionals import Sampling
from qilisdk.backends import QiliSim

# Create a 2‑qubit circuit
circuit = Circuit(2)
circuit.add(H(0))
circuit.add(CNOT(0, 1))

# Initialize the Sampling functional with 1000 shots
sampling = Sampling(circuit=circuit, nshots=1000)

# Use the QiliSim backend to execute the sampling
backend = QiliSim()
result = backend.execute(sampling)
print(result)
```

Time evolution with QiliSim can be done as follows:
```python
from qilisdk.analog import Schedule, X, Z, Y
from qilisdk.core import ket, tensor_prod
from qilisdk.core.interpolator import Interpolation
from qilisdk.backends import QiliSim
from qilisdk.functionals import TimeEvolution

# Define total time and timestep
T = 10.0
dt = 0.5
nqubits = 1

# Define Hamiltonians
Hx = sum(X(i) for i in range(nqubits))
Hz = sum(Z(i) for i in range(nqubits))

# Build a time‑dependent schedule
schedule = Schedule(
    hamiltonians={"driver": Hx, "problem": Hz},
    coefficients={
        "driver": {(0.0, T): lambda t: 1 - t / T},
        "problem": {(0.0, T): lambda t: t / T},
    },
    dt=dt,
    interpolation=Interpolation.LINEAR,
)

# Prepare an equal superposition initial state
initial_state = tensor_prod([(ket(0) - ket(1)).unit() for _ in range(nqubits)]).unit()

# Create the TimeEvolution functional
time_evolution = TimeEvolution(
    schedule=schedule,
    initial_state=initial_state,
    observables=[Z(0), X(0), Y(0)],
    nshots=100,
    store_intermediate_results=False,
)

# Execute on the QiliSim backend and inspect results
backend = QiliSim()
results = backend.execute(time_evolution)
print(results)
```
