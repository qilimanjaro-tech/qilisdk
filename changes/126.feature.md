Added a new simulation backend: QiliSim. This is an internal simulator written in C++. It offers improved performance compared to the QuTiP CPU simulator and can even be faster than the CUDA backend for some small test cases. Both circuit simulation and time evolution are supported. There are a number of time evolution methods: direct exponention, Anrolid/Krylov exponentiation, RK4 integration, and Monte Carlo (which can be combined with any of the previous methods).
