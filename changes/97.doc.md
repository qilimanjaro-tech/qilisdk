Documentation refresh across the project:

- README now links to the hosted docs and the SpeQtrum snippet walks through building a circuit, logging in, picking a device, and submitting a `Sampling` job.
- Digital fundamentals gained a rendered circuit figure, QuTiP execution example for `HardwareEfficientAnsatz`, a clarified measurement note, and a new “build your own ansatz” walkthrough with code.
- Analog fundamentals had their operator headings cleaned up, and the shared custom CSS now ships Plus Jakarta Sans, gradient headers, and dark-mode inline-code styling; the circuit diagram image is tracked under `_static/`.
- The `time_evolution.ipynb` example notebook was stripped of bulky outputs/metadata to keep the repo lightweight.
- Installation docs call out CUDA GPU requirements and defer hands-on content to a brand-new Quickstart guide (added to the index) that hosts the digital and analog walkthroughs plus backend-specific notes.
- Backend fundamentals now highlight how to install optional extras and link back to the Installation guide for details.
