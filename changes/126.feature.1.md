Added method to generate a randomized circuit from a set of single- and two-qubit gates, providing a useful tool for benchmarking.
Usage is as follows:
```python
from qilisdk.digital import Circuit, X, H, CNOT
c = Circuit.random(
    nqubits=3,
    single_qubit_gates=[X, H],
    two_qubit_gates=[CNOT],
    ngates=10,
)
```
