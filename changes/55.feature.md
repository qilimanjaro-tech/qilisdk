The QiliSDK settings system has been refactored to use Pydantic v2 and the `pydantic-settings` package, enabling centralized, validated configuration through environment variables. Each setting is defined in a structured `QiliSDKSettings` class, automatically loaded via a singleton `get_settings()` accessor. Environment variables follow a consistent `QILISDK_` prefix, and fields are now cleanly documented and type-safe. This change simplifies configuration management, eliminates scattered `os.environ` usage, and improves testability and documentation integration with AutoAPI.
