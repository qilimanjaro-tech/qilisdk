SpeQtrum's synchronous client now runs every request through a shared HTTPX client that refreshes bearer tokens automatically, ensuring submissions, listings, and polling continue seamlessly after 401s while still applying the SDK user agent. API failures now raise a dedicated SpeQtrum error that includes the message returned by the service and is logged in a human-friendly way, and job detail payloads, logs, and results are decoded defensively so malformed base64 no longer crashes the SDK.
