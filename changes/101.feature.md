Introduced the first version of the `CircuitTranspiler` alongside the `DecomposeMultiControlledGatesPass` that decomposes any multi-controlled single-qubit gate, enabling both CUDA and QuTiP backends to execute circuits containing such constructs. The pass is wired directly into both backends today while the full transpiler pipeline is staged for future expansion.
