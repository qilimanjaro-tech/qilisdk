CUDA 13 is now officially supported alongside CUDA 12, and the optional dependency system has been refactored to support these mutually exclusive CUDA variants in a clean and explicit way. The internal optional-import mechanism now supports "ANY-of" dependency groups, allowing a feature (e.g., `cuda`) to be satisfied by one of multiple provider distributions. For CUDA, this means QiliSDK now supports either the CUDA 12 or CUDA 13 packages without ambiguity. If neither is installed, the exported CUDA symbols (such as `CudaBackend`) resolve to informative stubs that raise an `OptionalDependencyError` with clear installation instructions indicating the valid extras.

Two new mutually exclusive extras are introduced:

* `cuda12` → installs the CUDA 12 backend stack
* `cuda13` → installs the CUDA 13 backend stack

In addition, aggregated extras are provided for convenience:

* `all-cu12` → installs all optional features plus CUDA 12
* `all-cu13` → installs all optional features plus CUDA 13

User installation examples:

* Core only (no CUDA):
  `pip install qilisdk`

* CUDA 12:
  `pip install "qilisdk[cuda12]"`
  or
  `uv sync --extra cuda12`

* CUDA 13:
  `pip install "qilisdk[cuda13]"`
  or
  `uv sync --extra cuda13`

* Full stack with CUDA 12:
  `pip install "qilisdk[all-cu12]"`
  or
  `uv sync --extra all-cu12`

* Full stack with CUDA 13:
  `pip install "qilisdk[all-cu13]"`
  or
  `uv sync --extra all-cu13`

Developer installation examples:

* Development + CUDA 12:
  `uv sync --group dev --extra cuda12`
  or
  `pip install -e ".[dev,cuda12]"`

* Development + CUDA 13:
  `uv sync --group dev --extra cuda13`
  or
  `pip install -e ".[dev,cuda13]"`

* Development without CUDA (e.g., CPU CI):
  `uv sync --group dev`

This structure makes CUDA selection explicit, prevents incompatible binary stacks from being installed simultaneously, and keeps the public API stable while improving error messaging and installation clarity.
