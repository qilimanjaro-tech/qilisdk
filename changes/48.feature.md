You can now pass a custom callable to both `list_devices` and `list_jobs`, enabling flexible client‑side filtering without touching the server API. Two new convenience helpers extend the job‑handling workflow: `get_job_details` fetches a complete record (payload, results, logs, and error information) for a given job ID, while `wait_for_job` blocks the caller until that job reaches a terminal state—`COMPLETED`, `ERROR`, or `CANCELLED`. In addition, the execution helpers (`execute`, `evolve`, `run_vqe`, and `run_time_evolution`) have been streamlined to return only the integer job identifier, making immediate responses lighter and encouraging explicit follow‑up calls when you actually need detailed data.
