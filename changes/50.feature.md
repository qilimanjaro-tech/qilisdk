Introducing **Functionals**, a unified abstraction for quantum work units. The library now includes two functional families: **`Sampling`**, which executes gate‑based circuits and returns shot counts, and **`TimeEvolution`**, which drives Hamiltonian schedules and yields evolved states or expectation values. All back‑ends have been consolidated into the `qilisdk.backends` module and are now Functional‑aware—each advertises the families it supports and executes them via `backend.execute(functional)`. Meanwhile, **QaaS** has been refactored into a standalone API client located in the `qilisdk.qaas` module, providing endpoints for submitting Functionals to remote devices, monitoring job status, and listing available jobs and hardware.
