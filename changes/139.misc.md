Migrated the project from `mypy` to Astral’s `ty` as the unified static type checker and language server. This replaces the existing type-checking workflow with `ty` across development and CI, and required resolving the majority of newly reported typing issues to align the codebase with `ty`’s stricter and partially different type-analysis model. A small number of findings were intentionally left unresolved where they are non-actionable, low impact, or require broader refactors, and are tracked separately for follow-up.
