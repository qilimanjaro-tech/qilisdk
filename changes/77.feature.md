Implemented schedule plotting with theme options consistent with those available for circuits, along with new schedule style classes to improve customization. A new `LinearSchedule` has been added, implementing linear interpolation between user-defined coefficients across the schedule. In addition, both `Schedule` and `LinearSchedule` now enforce that the total duration `T` must be divisible by the time step `dt`.
