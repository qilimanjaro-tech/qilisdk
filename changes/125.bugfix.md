Optional dependency handling is now more robust: missing optional symbols are exported as attribute-aware stubs so both calling them and accessing members (e.g. `SpeQtrum.login()`) raises an informative `OptionalDependencyError` with the correct `pip install qilisdk[extra]` hint, and optional imports fall back to stubs even when a dependency is installed but fails during import.
