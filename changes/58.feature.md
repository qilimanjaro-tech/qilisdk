The entire project now funnels its diagnostics through a single Loguru pipeline. On import, `qilisdk.__init__` invokes `_logging.configure_logging()`, which reads `logging_config.yaml` (or any file you point to) and installs sinks, colour schemes, and per-library filters before attaching an intercept handler that routes **all** standard-library loggers to Loguru. Back-end drivers and the synchronous QaaS client have been instrumented with rich, level-appropriate messagesâ€”`DEBUG` traces payloads and HTTP timings, `INFO` announces lifecycle events, `SUCCESS` confirms completed actions, while `WARNING` and `ERROR` expose anomalies and failures. Configuration is now entirely declarative and lives in one place, `_logging.py`; downstream projects that merely `import qilisdk` inherit the same emoji-enhanced output automatically.  A new environment variable, **`QILISDK_LOGGING_CONFIG_PATH`**, has been added to `QiliSDKSettings`, letting users override the default YAML location without code changes.
