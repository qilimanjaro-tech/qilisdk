Reworked analog schedule timing so `T` derives from coefficients or an explicit max time and `tlist` is generated from `dt`, with all backends/renderers consuming the same steps (and tests adjusted accordingly); the interpolator now validates overlapping intervals, keeps interval endpoints only, and is exported via `qilisdk.core`; QuTiP builds Hamiltonians via `to_qtensor(...).dense()` with correct dimensions
