Integrated a tailored SonarQube quality profile for Qilimanjaro into the QiliSDK repository, enabling developers who use the SonarQube VS Code extension to automatically sync and apply the project’s custom static-analysis rules without manual configuration; this update also updates repository settings to reference the new profile and enforces our agreed quality gates and conventions consistently across environments, improving code quality feedback and reducing setup friction for contributors.
