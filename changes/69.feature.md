The core type has been renamed from `QuantumObject` to `QTensor` to better reflect its role as a quantum tensor and to clarify semantics across states and operators. Internally, the storage switches to CSR (`csr_matrix`) and the hot paths were rewritten to be sparse‑first: `ptrace` no longer densifies and instead (i) remaps COO indices for operators, and (ii) forms the reduced state via `M @ M†` directly for pure states, avoiding construction of full $N\times N$ density matrices. State constructors are faster and leaner: `ket`/`bra` compute the basis index in one pass rather than chaining Kronecker products. Expectation values avoid densification (`trace(Oρ)` via element‑wise multiply–sum), density‑matrix validation uses sparse eigenvalue checks (`eigsh`) with a small‑dimensional dense fallback, and `nqubits` is cached. Together these changes substantially reduce memory and improve runtime for large sparse workloads—most notably for partial traces, state preparation, and expectation values—while keeping the public surface largely intact (helpers `basis_state`, `ket`, `bra`, `tensor_prod`, `expect_val` now operate on `QTensor`). Minor behavior notes: `.data` is CSR; stricter power‑of‑two shape validation; `norm('tr')` returns `1.0` for valid density matrices and scalar norms return `|z|`; `expm` converts to CSC internally; `tensor_prod` rejects empty inputs; and `ket()` requires at least one qubit. Update code by replacing references to `QuantumObject` with `QTensor`.
