This release introduces a **draft** version of the new `QaaSBackend` as part of the optional `qaas` module (install with `pip install qilisdk[qaas]`). The `QaaSBackend` enables users to interface with Qilimanjaro's cloud-based Quantum-as-a-Service (QaaS) platform via synchronous HTTP calls, providing a unified backend that supports both digital and analog workflows.

In this update, the backend allows for secure login and logout operations using credentials sourced through method parameters or environment variables. The returned authenticated token is stored securily with `keyring`.

`QaaSBackend` implements both `DigitalBackend` and `AnalogBackend` interfaces, paving the way for future extensions that support executing digital circuits and performing analog evolutions. It also offers functionalities such as list available devices.
