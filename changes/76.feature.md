Adding the Experiment class to Speqtrum. This includes two experiments: Rabi and T1. 

Example of execution:

```python
import numpy as np
from qilisdk.speqtrum import SpeQtrum
from qilisdk.speqtrum.experiments import RabiExperiment, Rabi

# Authenticate with the SpeQtrum Quantum-as-a-Service (QaaS) platform
SpeQtrum.login(apikey="...", username="...")

# Create a SpeQtrum client instance for job submission
client = SpeQtrum()

# Define and submit a Rabi experiment on qubit 0,
# sweeping the drive duration across a range of values
job_id = client.submit(
    RabiExperiment(qubit=0, drive_duration_values=np.arange(...)),
    device_id=...,
)

# Wait for the remote job to complete and retrieve job details
job_details = client.wait_for_job(job_id)

# Access the processed RabiExperimentResult object
results = job_details.result.rabi_experiment_result

# Plot the experimental S21 response (amplitude vs. drive duration)
results.plot()
```
