Added a QAOA ansatz, as well as corresponding documentation. This ansatz combines a problem Hamiltonian and a mixer Hamiltonian, performing the alternating time evolution of both, scaled by some parameters. By adjusting the values of said parameters using a Variational functional, the energy of the problem Hamiltonian is minimized thus a solution to the original problem is found.
